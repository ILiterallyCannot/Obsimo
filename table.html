        <h2>Our goals for Obsimo</h2>
        <p>The goal of this app is to serve as a very important tool in helping students choose their study paths during their time at Jyväsykylä Univeristy of Applied Science. As more professional volunteers complete this, the students will have a clearer idea of what to choose according to the job title they are hoping to work toward. This app aims to give students the highest chance possible to get accepted into professional jobs after they graduate, and is is our wish that students will be able to use this app and the courses they chose to show your company that they have done the courses that you have specifically chosen for them.</p>
        <h2>What to do</h2>
        <p>The idea should be fairly simple: according to your specific job, or field of work, choose the courses that apply the most to your job. If the class teaches a skill that you <i>may</i> use once or twice, then it is better to leave it blank. Students only have enough time over the course of their studies to take about 15 classes listed here. You can see the mandatory courses by clicking on the "show mandatory courses button", you can see the elective studies by clicking on the "Tvt opinnot" button, and if you feel that there is something important missing from the entire table, you can send us an "add course" request by filling in form on the "Add a missing course" button.</p>
